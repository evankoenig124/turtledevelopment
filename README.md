TurtleTrack is a new habit tracker app that accurately tracks the habits of users and displays ways 
to complete daily tasks in order to develop new habits. Some users may want to keep a log of habits
they no longer want, or they could track habits they want/need to have a more enjoyable daily life.
TurtleTrack can notify the user of certain tasks they could complete, so they donâ€™t forget. This 
helps develop these habits faster. The app also provides motivation for certain tasks, which gives
positive reinforcement. These features help users be more comfortable with the app and more likely
to develop new habits/get rid of bad habits. TurtleTrack will allow the user to customize their 
experience, from color scheme to gaining trophies for their good work. TurtleTrack works hard to
help the user not grow uninterested in the habit tracker, weekly summaries of their habits and
streaks of their habits will also become available to the user.
